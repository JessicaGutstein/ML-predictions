In this project, 
I explored various supervised ML models to predict credit card spending. 

The most successful model I tested involved Linear Regression leveraging
polynomial features, which secured the lowest prediction error. A strong
secondary result was also achieved through an ensemble model combining linear regression and
decision trees.
